# CognitiveServices-OCRSamples
Just a small repo that will contain different ways to consume the OCR API from Azure Cognitive Services

The intention of this repo is also to build an OCR reader that transforms the OCR result to a single region separated by horizontal lines instead of separating the results into multiple regions that could be made of columns and/or rows depending on the grouping.
