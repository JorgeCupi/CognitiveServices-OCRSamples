# CognitiveServices-OCRSamples
The intention of this repo is to build an OCR reader that transforms the OCR result to a single region separated by horizontal lines instead of separating the results into multiple regions that could be made of columns and/or rows depending on the grouping.

## How to use this sample ##
A Microsoft Azure account with a created Compute Vision service is needed to follow this sample. 

> NOTE: If you don't have an account yet you can create one for free on the [official page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

To be able to run the source code it is needed to copy and paste the Vision service's URL and Key from the portal and paste it on the <b>App.config</b> file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
    <startup> 
        // ... Some configuration values here
    </startup>
    <appSettings>
      <add key="ComputerVisionKey" value="yourComputerVisionKey"/>
      <add key="ComputerVisionUri" value="yourComputerVisionUriBase"/>
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

Note that the URL in the portal will look like this:

```console
https://[yourAzureRegion].api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0
```

Some parameters are also needed before pasting the URL to the config file. A language parameter set to unknown and a true flag for the service to detect the orientation of the image are added:

```console
/ocr?language=unk%26detectOrientation=true
```
So, the final URL on the <b>App.config</b> file should look like this:

```console
https://[yourAzureRegion].api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/ocr?language=unk%26detectOrientation=true
```

## Regions vs horizontal lines ##
OCR service from Compute Vision returns a Json object with the following format:
- The identified language of the text,
- The text angle,
- Orientation from the text,
- A list of regions

The detailed explanation of each of these parameters can be found at the [REST API official documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc)

In short terms, a region is an identified group of lines that at the same time contains words. Depending on the image complexity, the regions might or might not represent the true order of the words given that the service. Below are two examples: 

### Easy scenario: ###

In this case, the service will only return one region that contains all the words in almost perfect order:

```console
0

Hi, I'm SN. This text is a scam and not 
genuine correspondence from Lloyds Bank. 
Thanks for taking the time to notify us and 
you may wish to delete the text and block the 
sender if your phone allows you. 
```

Only one region was identified:

### Not so easy scenario ###

Since the image above contains words in multiple columns and rows without an obvious order the service returns a confusing result:

```console

So, how many regions were identified?

![4 regions were identified on the image](images/confusingSample.PNG)

4 regions. Apparently ordered from top to bottom and left to right.

## Converting regions to horizontal lines ##
ToDo...
